DONE:

home page sectios and button are done;

NOT DONE:
- Move on to coding the sections in the blog page,  buttons, img,.......

- Why am I getting warning for widths that are not null

- Still need to figure out typography and colors for the page

- think of DRY way to color square button borders

- add text shadow to titles
    - maybe add a 3D effect to the buttons or title

- Footer

- Calculate read time; Medium has a pretty good article on it

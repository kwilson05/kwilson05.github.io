legability:
  does the typeface have a good text height? 60 to 75 percent on cap height

  letter spacing: important for smaller heights

  overall even color




text and display typeface


Mood:
  Think about the contents mood; See if the typeface speaks in that certain mood



Make sure the typeface has everything you need:
  different line weights
  italic styles
  different widths for versatility
  what accented chars are included
  look numerical chars

numberic old style: vary in height nice for text and body copy necessary for
small text

numeric lining figures: better for headers

high x-height, large counters, loose letter spacing is good for body copy


When picking body text:
  - Look at stroke contrast and stroke consistency
  - Optical; Try to a type face with different optical sizes for a font
  - x height;  In order for letters to maintain clarity and understandability,
  they must have a consistent rhythm, as well as include large, open forms.
  - THE SPACES INSIDE OF LETTERS
      - Do the ascenders and descenders have enough room, particularly f
      and g? Do the counterforms inside of roundish letters
      (e.g., b, d, p, q, o) have the same optical size and color
      as those inside of straight-sided letters like, h, n, m, and u?
      How different from one another are the forms of the capital I, the
      lowercase i and l, and the figure 1? Can the 3 and the
      8 be quickly differentiated from each other? How about the 5 and the 6?

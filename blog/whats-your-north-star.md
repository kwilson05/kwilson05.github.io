Since being laid off last December, a recurring theme has been popping up in chats with my friends: 'What's Your North Star?' I always make yearly goals, but what are those goals driving me towards?<br /> <br />

Losing my job made me feel like a failure, which triggered me to think about all my choices leading up to being furloughed. I honestly didn't know why I made some past decisions. Were external factors driving me? Family, friends, past partners, or, even worse, social media? It made me feel like a cat with a hairball stuck in its throat.

Well, you have to start somewhere, and I wanted to make sure my next job was aligned with my North Star. Sooooo, with all this FREE time, I spent a day or two thinking about what I wanted out of life. <br />

Here's what I came up with:

<div style="margin-left: 24px">
  <li> Become a staff/principal engineer;</li>
  <li>  *** an outdoor guide</li>
  <li>  *** a husband and father of two (I want two kids; not gremlins if that's what you were thinking) </li>
  <li>   Give back to my community </li>
</div>
<br />

Okay...okay, now we're cooking!!! With these pillars, I've been searching for jobs that will push me towards being a staff engineer, while giving back to my community or a social cause. There are plenty of job opportunities, even in this market. But, not too many align with giving back to the community. [Fast Forward](https://jobs.ffwd.org/jobs), [{key:values}](https://www.keyvalues.com/), and [Climatebase](https://climatebase.org/) helped in that regard, but there are still limited opportunities. I'll keep trying though. Maybe I'll lean out my needs by solely focusing on getting a job that pushes toward a staff engineer. We'll see, we will see!! But, I'm happy to be making choices aligned with myself. It makes this a worthwhile journey!!! 🙂

Reach out @ <soziandwelewilson@gmail.com> if you know of any other job search sites that help find companies working toward a social cause. You can also just hit me up to say, "Hey there, sir!!!" or give me feedback on my blog.

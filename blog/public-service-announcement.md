What’s up, everyone! I’m planning to use this blog to share my experiences (mostly software dev related) in public or [“learn in public”](https://learninpublic.org/), like [Shawn Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) suggested. It’s funny -- I bought his book, The Coding Career Handbook, 5 years ago, but I am only starting to learn in public. Procrastination at its finest! Well, I am glad I didn’t wait another 5 years. :) <br /><br />

I hope you enjoy this journey with me! <br /> <br />

Much love.

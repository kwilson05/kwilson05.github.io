    <h1>Kasozi Wilson</h1>
    <p>
        What's going on! I'm a software engineer, runner, hiker and potter based
        in the Bronx, NY. I've been writing code since 2014, hard to believe
        honestly. (ðŸ˜¬) Most of that experience has been centered around web
        development. Currently, I'm making measurement meaningful by matching
        students to learning resources at
        <ExternalLink href={META_METRICS_URL}>MetaMetrics</ExternalLink>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before MetaMetrics, I lead projects as a Lead Developer at
        <ExternalLink href={INGEN_SOFTWARE_URL}>Ingen Software</ExternalLink> and
        was a software developer at &nbsp;<ExternalLink href={ESYSTEM_INC_URL}
            >Esystems Inc</ExternalLink
        >.
    </p>
    <p>Catch me on <ExternalLink href={GITHUB_URL}>Github</ExternalLink>.</p>

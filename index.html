        <p>I am a forever learner who luckily chose a career where innovation is not scarce.
    I attack most of my problems with some Java but HTML and CSS are becoming apart of my toolset too.
    Javascript will be my new tool to learn in 2017.</p>

      <p>
      If I am not programming, you'll see training for some triathlon/race or eating pancakes. I can't forget PANCAKES!!
      </p>

      <p>Keep up with me by checking out my Blog, GitHub, StackOverflow, and Strava:</p>

Consider what taking a simple photograph meant 25 years ago. You had film cameras, negatives, dark rooms, emulsions, and paper. It would take days to produce a picture you could show to someone. Now consider what taking a photograph means today. With a smartphone that fits in our pocket, we can capture a photo, edit it, view it, and show it to anyone, all in as a little as a few seconds. These fantastic devices are simultaneously capable of capturing high resolution visuals, displaying them, and immediately distributing them to a billion other devices similarly capable of the exact same things. It is now actually perceivable that a photo you take one moment could be seen by over half of the entire human population a moment later. This power in visual expression has never existed before.

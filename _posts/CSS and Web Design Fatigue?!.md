<h1>CSS and Web Design Fatigue?!</h1>


In the past year, I've seen/heard so many developers speak of Javascript fatigue but
what about CSS/Web Design fatigue. I started learning CSS November 2016 to build this static site
and man, it was ROUGH. I think it took literally a week to learn how to place my center my p tags.
After learning the syntax, I ran into the classic cascading issue. Yeah like most newbs, I seperated my
CSS by the different site pages. YIKES!! BAD IDEA..
Then, there's learning people will view your site at through different viewports. How do I change
my site's content to fit on different viewports? OH! and I need to make my fonts pop off the screen a little more.
Everything is a little too bland...How do I do this?

Mozilla Devloper Network(MDN), SlashRocket, Does Not Compute(DNC) podcast and teamtreehouse was a great resource.
